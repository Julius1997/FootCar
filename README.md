# FootCar
Football-like game played with car-like players, juste like Rocket League but in 2D

Made to play between computers (on Windows) all connected to the same wifi router.

Just run the file FootCar_Wifi.py, it will geneate the tkinter menu of the game.
From there you can either host a new game by creating a server or join another server already created.

player commands:
 - gas and break with up and down arrows
 - change directions with left and right arrows
 - drift with d

Code commented in french.
